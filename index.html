      <h1 class="title4">Ready to see Gyantse?</h1>
      <div class="info-box4">
        <p>
          Officially known as Gyangzê Town, Gyantse in Shigatse Prefecture of Tibet Autonomous Region was once considered to be the third largest city in Tibet, although there are now several much larger towns in the region. Located in the Nyang Chu Valley, the town lies on what was once one of the ancient trade routes between Tibet and the Sikkim Province of India. Old trade routes led from Gyantse to Shigatse to the west and up over the Karo La Pass into central Tibet.
        </p>
        <h2>What to expect</h2>
        <p>
          The most popular sight in the town is the famous Gyantse Kumbum, the largest chorten in Tibet, 
          and one of the most amazing pieces of Tibetan architecture in the region. Commissioned by one of the former princes of Gyantse in 1427, the Kumbum sits inside the Pelkor Chode Monastery complex, and is the most popular attraction in the town. At 35 meters high, the chorten has nine levels, known as Lhakhangs, and is topped by a golden dome. Containing 77 chapels that line the interior walls of the chorten, it houses over 10,000 paintings that adorn the walls of the chapels.
        </p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <p>
          The word “kumbum” translates to mean “100,000 images”, and while there may not be that many inside, the name is very apt. The Gyantse Kumbum is considered to be the most important of its kind in the region, as the only two similar kumbums in Tibet now lie in ruins in remote and off-limits areas of the region.

          “Wherever I live, I shall feel homesick for Tibet. I often think I can still hear the cries of wild geese and cranes and the beating of their wings as they fly over Lhasa in the clear, cold moonlight. My heartfelt wish is that my story may create some understanding for a people whose will to live in peace and freedom has won so little sympathy from an indifferent world.”
